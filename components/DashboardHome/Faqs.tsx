              If you are an e-commerce vendor and/or dropshipper selling brand
              name goods then this app was designed for you. We compile a series
              of Google ads Operations and combined them into a few clicks. What
              would have taken hours is now down in a matter of seconds. With
              that, we aim to save you time (something you can't back) & money.

              Standard limitations apply to our app and are set forth by
              Google's API team. For instance, performing an operation on
              +10,000 products, may cause errors. Therefore we have put
              limitations in place to prevent exceeding these limits. Also,
              certain features may be limited in fullness through our design to
              align with intended purposes of the app.

              No, while our app provides essential features required for a basic
              shopping ads experience, our service is not aimed as a replacement
              to Google Shopping, but instead a supplementation. Our app
              provides basic necessary features and functionality to create,
              view, edit and delete Shopping ads related data through the Google
              ads Api.
